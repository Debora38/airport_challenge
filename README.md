## Debora Airport Challenge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Debora38/airport_challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Debora38/airport_challenge)

The first Weekend Challenge at Makers Academy included the following summarised steps:

<li> Build an Airport
<li> Make planes land and take off
<li> Keep track of planes in the airport or in flight
<li> Add random weather condition as stormy or sunny
<li> Raise errors when a plane tries to land or take off in a storm
<li> Set an airport capacity
<li> Raise error when a plane tries to land in a full airport

### Goals of the week
Our first week at Makers made us focus on TDD, as in starting from feature test, implementing unit tests and then only code and refactor.
In this challenge, I have noticed how it still comes automated to me, to think about the code straight away, however I made the effort to work on testing first, making myself more familiar with rspec.
